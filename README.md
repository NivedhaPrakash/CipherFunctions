# CipherFunctions
Assuming the following cipher: 1=A, 2=B, 3=C,...,26=Z,27=AA, 28=AB, â€¦ write a python function which takes two integers m and n (1 &lt; m &lt; n &lt; 676) and prints the character equivalents of each in a new line.
I have imported String and combination_with_replacement package to get the 2 digit string with all combinations.I have used string.ascii_lowercase to get the alphabet in a list.
